# xTCP - its NOT a TCP!

Pretty simple, all you need to do is git clone -> python main.py ->  browser.

Git clone the repo:
```
git clone github.com/Synthxyl704/xTCP
```

Run main:
```
python main.py
```

Now yes there might be some TLS issues in your code but I wont really assume youre interested enough to run your own OpenSSL certificate. <br>
So, for now, just use the loopback address w/ HTTP.
